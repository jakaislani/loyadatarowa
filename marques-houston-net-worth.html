Houston has had a number of commercially successful solo studio albums that have achieved platinum status in the US.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marques Houston career</h2><p>Houston joined the R&B group Immature (commonly known as IMx) as a founding member in 1992.</p><p>Along with Chris Stokes, who serves as their manager, the group’s members are Don “Half Pint” Santos and Jerome “Romeo” Jones (who was later replaced by Kelton “LDB” Kessee). “Batman” was Houston’s nick name during this time.</p><p>The group changed their name in 1999, and they went on to release two albums under the moniker IMx: Introducing IMx (1999) and IMx (2001). The ensemble also ventured into acting, making appearances on programs like Sister, Sister and A Different World.</p><p>Before breaking up in 2002, they produced music for the soundtracks of the movies House Party 3 and House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute.</p><p>Houston started pursuing a solo career in 2003. On October 21, 2003, he released MH under his birth name of Marques Houston.</p><p>The songs “That Girl”, “Clubbin'” (with Joe Budden and R.

After reverting to their previous moniker, Immature, the group dropped “Let Me Find Out” as their next song in late 2014.</p><p>Remember, their resumé EP, was released in the beginning of 2015. Later that year, Houston made his solo single “Need You” from the Will to Love soundtrack available.</p><p>Houston has released the tune “Complete Me” to streaming and download retailers. In September, he debuted a music video for the song.</p><p>The song was supposed to be the lead single from his upcoming album White Party, which was due out later that year.</p><p>This album, however, was never released.
