The two tied the knot on <i>23 April 1997</i> in a very intimate marriage ceremony. The two first met somewhere around the 1990s but neither of them has disclosed the exact date of their meeting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/12/Ian%20and%20Regina%20King-1579457841588%20(1)-1581497464930.jpg><p>The two started dating and finally got hitched. She commented on her marriage that she never thought of getting married until she met Ian. They were living blissfully until 2007 when their relation crumbled down. The duo ended their marital relationship in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>There was speculation of Alexander Sr. extramarital affair to be the cause of their divorce. Similarly, there were allegations of physical abuse and drug use leveled against Alexander.</p><h2>Regina And Ian In Good Terms Because Of Their Son, Ian Alexander Jr.</h2><p>Being together for ten years, not only they share a bond of husband and wife but also of a parent; the ex-couple shares a son together named <strong>Ian Alexander Jr.</strong> Their son was born before they were married.

She told <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Essence</strong></a> that not long after their divorce, the ex-pair attended their son's basketball game where they were sitting on the opposite side. Then she realized that on occasion like that, the parents should be together not miles apart.</p><p>So, she decided to talk to him even though she was pissed because of the messiness that had gone during their break-up. After the game finished, she reached out to him and said Ian Sr.,</p><p>"You know what? This is not good for Ian. Let's put this all behind us because it has nothing to do with how much we both love him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/12/2019+LACMA+Art+Film+Gala+Honoring+Betye+Saar+wtq86JTJquvx-1581497527424.jpg><p>Fortunately, Ian Sr. agreed, and they are friends as of now.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dating And Relationships Of Regina King</h2><p>After four years of her divorce, she dated <strong>Malcolm-Jamal Warner</strong>, who is a well-known American actor, director, producer, and musician by profession.
