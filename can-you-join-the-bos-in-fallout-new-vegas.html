There are two paths you can take to join the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout: New Vegas. However, <b>you must complete the quest “Still in the Dark” in order to start either quest</b>.</span></span><h2>Can you join the NCR and the Brotherhood?</h2>You can not get BoS and NCR to fight together in the endgame, but you can get them together.<h2>Can you join factions in Fallout: New Vegas?</h2>Major factions<p>The following factions are the 3 major players in New Vegas. During the course of the game, you will eventually have the option to side with one of them, or go it alone, to the expense of your relations with the other major factions.</p><h2>Can you join Caesar's Legion as a female?</h2>Caesar and the Legion see a female courier as an outlier. Caesar is legitimately impressed by how much courier goes through that by the time that they meet he's willing to allow a woman to join their ranks. A female courier doesn't get all the options a male courier does though, they are unable to compete in the arena.<h2>Can you join Caesar's Legion?</h2>Caesar's Legion is a ruthless slaver society who is at the doorstep of the NCR (New California Republic) and Mr. House in Fallout: New Vegas. If their group interests you, it is possible to join their ranks and serve under Caesar.<h2>Fallout: New Vegas - How to Access The Brotherhood of Steel Base</h2><p></p><h2>Can the Brotherhood of Steel join Mr House?</h2>He and John Gonzalez discussed the situation, and agreed that it would be in-character for Mr. House to not tolerate the Brotherhood. Additionally, it would be a more difficult and compelling choice for the player to make.<h2>Can the Brotherhood of Steel join Yes Man?</h2>Although the Brotherhood of Steel will not side with the Courier and Yes Man, one has three solutions: Destroy Hidden Valley.<h2>How do I get idolized by BoS?</h2>Complete the mission they give you (for Hardin it's to kill the Van Graffs, for McNamara it's to tap into the radar at Black Mountain), and you will get "idolized". It may be that you need to complete Veronica's mission as well, and get her to stay with the BOS.<h2>Can you be idolized by everyone?</h2>No. You can't reach idolized with both Legion and NCR, and I'm pretty sure you can't do it with both Goodsprings and Powder Gangers.<h2>How do I join Brotherhood of Steel?</h2>Joining the Brotherhood of Steel<p>The Base of operations of the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 4 is the Police Station. After completing the quest, "Call to Arms" Paladin Danse will ask the player if they would like to join the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><h2>How do I join the brotherhood?</h2>To join the Brotherhood, simply kill one of the hostages, and you will be immediately invited into the feared secret society. Accept the invitation, and you are in. If you attack and kill Astrid, you'll start a questline to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, so choose wisely!<h2>Can the brotherhood help at Hoover Dam?</h2>House orders you to kill them, and the BoS will only help the NCR. You can spare them if you side with yes man though. Nope, Mr. House is vehemently opposed to the Brotherhood of Steel, he even refers to them as terrorists if you talk to him about them.<h2>Can the Brotherhood of Steel join the Legion?</h2>But the two factions are mutually incompatible. The basis of BoS philosophy is both that technology must be preserved and that it must not be allowed to fall into the "wrong hands", with the wrong hands being anybody not BoS.<h2>What happens if you bug the Lucky 38?</h2>After bugging the computer, Emily may enter the Lucky 38 casino to ask the player character if they have completed their task. She may even enter the presidential suite. If the player character has not planted the bug in a certain time, Emily will remind them as they leave a room, including inside the Lucky 38.<h2>Will Veronica leave if I destroy the brotherhood?</h2>Veronica will leave if your BoS reputation falls below a certain value. Destroying the BoS will give you a massive reputation hit, so you will most likely fall below the reputation required for keeping Veronica. At least the NCR quests you can do without having to kill the Brotherhood, as far as I remember.<h2>Should I wipe out the Brotherhood of Steel?</h2>Should I kill the BoS? Yes. Its worth noting that the Brotherhood of Steel chapter here in Nevada are not tied to the rest of the BOS directly.<h2>Do you have to destroy the BoS?</h2>Do I have to kill the BoS? No, you either have to kill them or leave them be.<h2>Can I officially join the NCR?</h2>You can't actually join them. You can unlock their safe house and be idolized and stuff, but you can't join them.<h2>Can Caesar's Legion ally with the Brotherhood of Steel?</h2>You can't.<h2>Can Veronica join the followers?</h2>Veronica can be recruited at the 188 Trading Post by simply talking to her. As long as the player character does not make themselves out to be an enemy of the Brotherhood, she will ask if she can join their party and reveal her association with the order once she is accepted.<h2>Can the enclave help Yes Man?</h2>So, is it possible to side with Yes Man and getting support from the Enclave as well? Yes, you can. You have to convince the Remnants to fight for the NCR, and then switch allegiance yourself. One of the Remnants will turn on you, but the rest will help you out even if you side with Yes Man or House.<h2>What's the best ending in Fallout: New Vegas?</h2>House would be the best ending for Vegas itself, but the NCR is the best ending for the whole of the Mojave, despite its corruption and taxes. The Legion would rule with an iron fist, and collapse as soon as Caesar dies. In the Independent ending there wouldn't be much stability in the Mojave at all.<h2>Can I side with NCR and Yes Man?</h2>You can juggle the four mains, put to a certain point. You can work for Huose up until the Kimball quest. You can do Yes Man either to the point of installing him in the Lucky 38 mainframe OR do all side-quests for him (but not both). You can do NCR up until either the BoS or Kimball.<h2>Can you complete Semper Invicta?</h2>Yes, you will need to join the Brotherhood of Steel to complete this quest. There is no way to finish Semper Invicta without becoming a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.<h2>Can you join Brotherhood of Steel and Minutemen?</h2>It is possible to finish the game with the Railroad, Brotherhood of Steel, and Minutemen all allied together.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6q7vIp2StoJVir7C%2FjKKlZp6RobmwwdNmpZ6vXauyqK3S</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcan-you-join-the-bos-in-fallout-new-vegas.html&text=Can%20you%20join%20the%20BoS%20in%20Fallout%20New%20Vegas%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-you-join-the-bos-in-fallout-new-vegas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-join-the-bos-in-fallout-new-vegas.html&title=Can%20you%20join%20the%20BoS%20in%20Fallout%20New%20Vegas%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcan-you-join-the-bos-in-fallout-new-vegas.html&title=Can%20you%20join%20the%20BoS%20in%20Fallout%20New%20Vegas%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-join-the-bos-in-fallout-new-vegas.html&title=Can%20you%20join%20the%20BoS%20in%20Fallout%20New%20Vegas%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-you-join-the-bos-in-fallout-new-vegas.html&description=Can%20you%20join%20the%20BoS%20in%20Fallout%20New%20Vegas%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-beckinsale-net-worth-207368.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Beckinsale Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./betty-lynn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Betty Lynn">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
