That's what troubles me: I should like to suffer more for the expiation of my sins.<h2>What was Louis XIV saying?</h2>Every time I appoint someone to a vacant position, I make a hundred unhappy and one ungrateful.

Born 1755 in Vienna, at the tender age of 14 Marie Antoinette marries heir to the French throne Louis-Auguste, who later became King Louis XVI of France.<h2>How old was Louis XVI when he married Marie Antoinette?</h2>In 1770, she was finally sent to France for the formal marriage ceremony. She was 14 at the time, Louis was 15. On the big day, Louis donned a suit of silver, and Marie wore a lilac dress dripping with diamonds and pearls. There were over 5,000 guests, and a crowd of 200,000 watched the concluding fireworks display.<h2>Who invented the guillotine?</h2>It was originally developed as a more humane method of execution. The origins of the French guillotine date back to late-1789, when Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin proposed that the French government adopt a gentler method of execution.<h2>What is the oldest family in France?</h2>Montmorency Family: The Oldest in France.<h2>Who owns Versailles?</h2>One part of the initiative, the restoration of the Hall of Mirrors, was completed in 2006.

Autocrats regularly conflate the nations they rule with their own personas.<h2>Does the guillotine hurt?</h2>The condemned or their families would sometimes pay the executioner to ensure that the blade was sharp in order to achieve a quick and relatively painless death.<h2>Who was the first victim of the guillotine?</h2>21 in 1792 when Louis Collot d'Angremont, a secretary in the National Guard, became the first political victim of the guillotine in punishment for participating in a "conspiracy" against the government.<h2>How did Marie Antoinette do her hair?</h2>During Marie Antoinette's time in the French court, powdered hair was considered somewhat mandatory. Nobody showed up at court without it. The powder applied to posh people's heads consisted of either potato or rice flower starch (or Cyprus powder, which is made from reindeer moss or another similar lichen).<h2>How was Marie taken to the guillotine?</h2>The campaign against Marie Antoinette likewise grew stronger. In July 1793, she lost custody of her young son, who was forced to accuse her of sexual abuse and incest before a Revolutionary tribunal.
