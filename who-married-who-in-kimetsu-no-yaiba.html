After the Demon Slayers disbanded in the last chapter, the series underwent a huge skip in time from the Feudal era of Japan to modern-day Tokyo.<h2>Who Married with Nezuko?</h2>Eventually Zenitsu and Nezuko would marry and start a family as evidenced by their descendants.<h2>Who is Tanjiro's wife?</h2>After the battle, Tanjiro returns home with his sister and friends. Later it is revealed that he married fellow slayer Kanao Tsuyuri.<h2>Who is Inosuke's wife?</h2>At the end of the chapter, there is a picture of Inosuke giving acorns to Aoi while she smiles. It is confirmed in the Volume 23 extras that Inosuke and Aoi did eventually end up together and that they have two great-grandsons, one of which is Aoba.<h2>Demon Slayer: Parent and Child, Husband and Wife, Brother and Sister</h2><p></p><h2>Who married Tomioka?</h2>[Demon Slayer] Finally, Giyu Tomioka and Shinobu Kocho Married_1 - Bilibili.<h2>Who is Nezuko in love with?</h2>Zenitsu Agatsuma<p>Upon seeing her for the first time, Zenitsu falls in love with Nezuko at first sight. She apparently views Zenitsu as a "weird dandelion" and did not initially seem to reciprocate his feelings. Although the two are rarely seen interacting together, Zenitsu treats her with affection and care.</p><h2>Does Nezuko marry Inosuke?</h2>Eventually, she and Inosuke Hashibira marry and have a great-grandson named Aoba Hashibira.<h2>Are Shinobu and Giyuu dating?</h2>Shinobu and Giyuu are not implied to be a couple, but some think the way they interact with each other is endearing in a "bickering couple" kind of way. Despite Giyuu looking serious, he has an aloof and airheaded personality that people don't like.<h2>Who is Tanjiro's crush?</h2>But Demon Slayer introduced Tanjiro's main love interest briefly, and she doesn't really return until the end of the season, when she is fighting against him. His love interest that develops as the story goes on is Kanao Tsuyuri and their romance is quite adorable.<h2>Who is Kanao crush?</h2>It is implied in an extra chapter following the end of the Functional Recovery Training Arc that she may have had a crush on Tanjiro.<h2>Does Giyuu have a love interest?</h2>In the first season of the Demon Slayer anime, Giyu Tomioka is set next to Shinobu Kocho during the Natagumo Mountain Arc. Though Giyu is much too stoic to openly admit his admiration of Shinobu, it is clear that they share an interest in saving the demons who have had their lives stolen by Muzan Kibutsuji.<h2>Who married Mitsuri?</h2>In Chapter 205, we see Obanai and Mitsuri reincarnated and married, as they promised before they died, and they are running a restaurant together. In the volume extras it is revealed that they have five kids.<h2>Does Giyuu like Tanjiro?</h2>He is shown to care a lot for Tanjiro, which is further seen when he becomes greatly angered when Akaza attempts to kill Tanjiro, losing his usual stoic demeanour and jumping in to protect him from the Upper Rank.<h2>Does Shinobu like Suzu?</h2>Suzu. Shinobu has been Suzu's good friend since their early childhood. After Suzu had lost her mother to an accident at the age of six, Shinobu vouched to protect her from potential bullies who may make fun of her frequent crying.<h2>Does Giyuu like Shinobu?</h2>Although Giyu maintains a cold and distant stance, among all the pillars, Shinobu is the one who understands him the most and has the best relationship with him. Shinobu says that Giyuu is hated by other people, which can seem mean, but in reality she actually supports him.<h2>Who dies in Demon Slayer?</h2><p>Demon Slayer: 10 Saddest Deaths In The Manga</p><ul><li>Iguro Obanai. ...</li><li>Tamayo. ...</li><li>Kokushibo. ...</li><li>Gyomei Himejima. ...</li><li>Jigoro Kuwajima. ...</li><li>Shinobu Kocho. ...</li><li>Genya Shinazugawa. ...</li><li>Muichiro Tokito.</li></ul><h2>Did AOI like Tanjiro?</h2>Tanjiro Kamado<p>Aoi and Tanjiro seem to have formed a friendship. Tanjiro respects Aoi for her help and care while he, Inosuke, and Zenitsu resided at the Mansion. He also thanks her for her work and assistance, which she seems to appreciate.</p><h2>Is Zenitsu a girl?</h2>Appearance. Zenitsu is a young man with fair skin and downward-sloped, scared-looking eyes that fade from soft brown to gold.<h2>How old is Kanao?</h2>Kanao's birthday was decided to be May 19, the day when Shinobu and Kanae adopted her. She is currently 16 years old, making her older than Tanjiro.<h2>How many exes does Zenitsu have?</h2>Zenitsu's debt is estimated to be around 600,000 yen in modern currency. This massive amount of debt likely came from his 7 ex-girlfriends. Despite all of them being beautiful, they treated Zenitsu like a slave, tricked him as well as robbing him of his money. Zenitsu also never got to even hold their hands.<h2>Who is Giyuu sister?</h2>Tsutako Tomioka ( 冨 とみ 岡 おか 蔦 つた 子 こ , Tomioka Tsutako?) was the older sister of Giyu Tomioka.<h2>Who is rengoku girlfriend?</h2>Mitsuri Kanroji<p>The two of them share a gluttonous side and enjoyed snacking on their breaks. Mitsuri derived her own unique Breathing Style, Love Breathing, from his Flame Breathing.</p><h2>How old is Giyuu?</h2>At just 19 years old, Giyuu is considered the strongest of the nine Hashira.<h2>Who is Mitsuri's love interest?</h2>Obanai Iguro<p>Obanai is deeply in love with Mitsuri, as he has stated in the manga. He feels as if he can't tell her, however, this is because of his "filthy blood", caused by the trauma he had endured in the past. He first saw her when she stood under a sakura tree, which is where he fell in love with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmalkae%2FqrHDZq6hp12eu263yKacraulYruwediaoJuZ</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-married-who-in-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html&text=Who%20married%20who%20in%20Kimetsu%20no%20yaiba%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-married-who-in-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-married-who-in-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html&title=Who%20married%20who%20in%20Kimetsu%20no%20yaiba%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-married-who-in-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html&title=Who%20married%20who%20in%20Kimetsu%20no%20yaiba%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-married-who-in-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html&title=Who%20married%20who%20in%20Kimetsu%20no%20yaiba%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-married-who-in-kimetsu-no-yaiba.html&description=Who%20married%20who%20in%20Kimetsu%20no%20yaiba%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./friends-star-courteney-cox-opens-up-about-cosmetic-surgery-i-had-to-stop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Friends star Courteney Cox opens up about cosmetic surgery: 'I had to stop'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./man-from-reno-2015.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man from Reno movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
