At the time, Reynolds was&nbsp;26.</p><p>They had a solid cast and crew—one which was often described by insiders as being “like a family”—and Burt Reynolds had quite the reputation.</p><p>He had recently—and publically—demanded his way out of a contract with NBC’s hit Western series, Riverboat.</p><p>The actor had clashed with co-star Darren McGavin—and would continue to do so for years afterwards.</p><p>He had also criticized his character as being “bland” in television and radio interviews.</p><p>While the charismatic and talented young star wasn’t blacklisted, his reputation around television networks wasn’t as stellar as his list of credits.</p><p>As it turned out, though, Reynolds got along with his Gunsmoke co-stars like a house on fire.</p><h2><strong>Did Burt cause trouble on Gunsmoke?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59072 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-old-was-burt-reynolds-when-he-played-in-gunsmoke.jpg.webp alt="how old was burt reynolds when he played in gunsmoke" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -

Get out of here.”</p><p>Taken aback, Burt thought Milburn was trying to get rid of him.</p><p>He says he cringes over what he said next.</p><p>“I asked [Milburn], “Don’t you like me?” Gentleman that he was, he said, “I love your work. It’s time you think about your movie career.”</p><p>Reynolds said that was all it took. “I knew he was the smartest guy—I always thought that. He was so wonderful.
