Her better partner Mitchell became the sole director of her firm Sauce E Limited the year following her death, according to the formal documents. Mitchell was a 25% owner in the company prior to her death. Until 2019, the company’s accounts showed a working capital of £1 million, including £920,000 in cash. Windsor’s fortune was allegedly amassed while working on the long-running TV series EastEnders. Between 1994 through 2016, she played the role of Peggy Mitchell on the program. Windsor was reputedly in debt to the tune of £1 million prior to her success on the famed television show. However, at the time of her death, the actress’s net worth was reported to be approximately £10 million.</p><h2>Barbara Windsor’s Death Resulted in a Deluge of Tributes</h2><p>Six years before her death, Windsor was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Her devoted hubby cared for her over those years, until she was ultimately placed in a London care facility in the summer of 2020.&nbsp;Mitchell issued a statement after her death, stating, “It is with extreme regret that I can report that my lovely wife Barbara [Windsor] died at 8:35 p.m. on Thursday, December 10, at a London care facility.”&nbsp;The spouse said that he spent a week at her side before she died gently as a result of her sickness.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Scott-Mitchell-1.jpg alt="Scott Mitchell " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When the news of Windsor’s death became public, condolences from all over the globe began to pour in on different social media sites. Among the numerous responses was a poignant tribute sent by her EastEnders co-star Patsy Palmer. Following Windsor’s death, actress Palmer turned to Twitter to write a series of messages. “We were like a family for a long time, ups and downs, ins and outs, but you will never meet a more professional actress than Barbs [Windsor],” she tweeted. Similarly, Palmer praised Mitchell’s assistance to his ailing wife, referring to him as the finest better half she could have dreamed for.&nbsp;“You deserve the greatest honor,” the actress said in the last line.&nbsp;In her reminiscence, she said that she will treasure all of their “wonderful experiences” as co-actors.&nbsp;Furthermore, Windsor’s former co-star claimed that she could still hear her laugh and yearned for it to echo in her ears forever.</p><h2>Barbara Windsor’s Relationship History with Husband</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Barbara-windsor.jpg alt="Barbara windsor" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Windsor and her husband Mitchell initially met when they were fifty-five and thirty, respectively, after mutual acquaintances introduced them.&nbsp;Windsor was still married to her second husband, Stephen Hollings, at the time she began dating Mitchell.&nbsp;“We were both aware that strong emotions were churning. When I did anything out of character, I had a feeling it was serious “The late actress was quoted as saying.&nbsp;Windsor was the one who initiated their connection by inviting Mitchell on a date.</p><p>Her second husband, upon learning of her affair, mocked her for marrying a guy twenty-five years her junior.&nbsp;In 2000, the pair exchanged vows in a tiny covert ceremony at a Dorchester hotel in the presence of three witnesses.&nbsp;Windsor is survived alone by her third husband since she has no children from any of her previous partnerships.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnKekqXqutdOcn56knGKvpq%2FAppxmrJiaerS7y55knaGimrC1u9FmmJ%2Bslad6o63Rm5irmV2stq%2Bw0qipZpyVlsGpew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fscott-mitchell-became-the-sole-director-after-barbara-windsor-death.html&text=Scott%20Mitchell%20Became%20The%20Sole%20Director%20After%20Barbara%20Windsor%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscott-mitchell-became-the-sole-director-after-barbara-windsor-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscott-mitchell-became-the-sole-director-after-barbara-windsor-death.html&title=Scott%20Mitchell%20Became%20The%20Sole%20Director%20After%20Barbara%20Windsor%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fscott-mitchell-became-the-sole-director-after-barbara-windsor-death.html&title=Scott%20Mitchell%20Became%20The%20Sole%20Director%20After%20Barbara%20Windsor%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fscott-mitchell-became-the-sole-director-after-barbara-windsor-death.html&title=Scott%20Mitchell%20Became%20The%20Sole%20Director%20After%20Barbara%20Windsor%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscott-mitchell-became-the-sole-director-after-barbara-windsor-death.html&description=Scott%20Mitchell%20Became%20The%20Sole%20Director%20After%20Barbara%20Windsor%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tory-lanez-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-2-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tory Lanez Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michelle-mylett-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Mylett Net Worth: Acting Career &amp;amp; Cars [December , 2023 ] : Genius Celebs">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
