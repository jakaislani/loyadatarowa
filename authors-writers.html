She was an exceptional student and was invited to the White House as a Presidential Scholar out of high school. She studied in Germany on a Fulbright Scholarship, later teaching creative writing at Arizona State University. She has won numerous awards for her work, including a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for the book of poetry Thomas and Beulah. Other books from Dove include Mother Love and Sonata Mulattica.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Education and Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born in Akron, Ohio on August 28, 1952, Rita Dove developed a love for learning and literature at an early age in a household that encouraged reading. She was honored as a Presidential Scholar, being ranked as one of the top 100 high school students in the nation, and as a National Merit Scholar attended Ohio’s Miami University, graduating in 1973 summa cum laude. She subsequently studied abroad in Germany before returning to the states and earning her M.F.A. from the University of Iowa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She met fellow writer Fred Viebahn, also of Germany, in the mid-1970s while he was studying at the Univ. of Iowa.

She published chapbooks early in her career and made her mark with collections like The Yellow House on the Corner (1980) and Museum (1983). Dove is known not only for the layered eloquence of her language and ideas but also for portraying portions of the Black experience in America, both on a personal and collective front.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1986 she published Thomas and Beulah, a semi-autobiographical look at the lives of her grandparents that won the poetry Pulitzer Prize the following year.
