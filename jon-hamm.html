Early screen work included a role on the television drama Providence, but it was his performance as philandering ad executive Don Draper on AMC’s Mad Men that propelled him to fame and led to two Golden Globes and an Emmy win. Hamm has since made prominent contributions to movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still, Bridesmaids, Million Dollar Arm, and Baby Driver.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Jonathan Daniel Hamm<br>BORN: March 10, 1971<br>BIRTHPLACE: St. Louis, Missouri<br>SPOUSE: Anna Osceloa (2023-present)<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jonathan Daniel Hamm was born on March 10, 1971, in St. Louis. His father, Dan, had two daughters from his first marriage. His family owned a successful trucking company for generations in St. Louis, but the business declined as Jon grew up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his parents divorced when he was only 2 years old, Hamm lived with his mother, Deborah, and “tried a lot of different things—violin, soccer, creative writing,” he told In Style magazine. “My mother celebrated learning.” He saw his father on the weekends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of 10, Hamm lost his mother to colon cancer, which had spread throughout her body, and he moved to his grandmother’s house with his father. “We were three generations living under one roof, which is difficult in the best of circumstances,” Hamm told GQ. He found sanctuary from his difficult home life at the progressive John Burroughs Preparatory School. Some of his friends’ mothers also felt moved to look after him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An athlete and performer, Hamm was a linebacker on his school’s football team and had the leading role in a production of Godspell. He decided to go to the University of Texas, turning down offers to play football at several Ivy League colleges.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His time at the school was brief, however, due to personal hardships. First, his grandmother died. Shortly after, his father became ill. After struggling with his sickness, Dan died during Jon’s sophomore year of college. “I suddenly had no parents,” Hamm told W. “It was like I had no mooring.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Choosing to finish school at the University of Missouri, Hamm looked for work to support himself and got a job at a local day-care center. “I basically went out and pitched myself saying, ‘Here’s the deal. I was always a latchkey kid, so I was coming home or going to day care, and there were never any guys around,’” he explained to the Columbia Daily Tribune.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Interest in Theater" data-anchor-id=interest-in-theater class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Interest in Theater</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamm also became very active in the University of Missouri’s theater program. One of his professors, Jim Miller, said that Hamm “was the most intellectual actor I have had in 30 years of teaching,” according to an article in the university’s alumni magazine, Mizzou. He spent two summers performing in the school’s repertory company, starring as Cliff in Cabaret and Leon Colgosz in a production of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/stephen-sondheim data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen Sondheim" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stephen Sondheim</a>’s musical Assassins.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1993, Hamm earned a bachelor’s degree in English. He then landed a job as a teacher at his old school, John Burroughs. For two years, Hamm taught drama there, teaching students such as Ellie Kemper, who has since become a movie and television actor. He also made friends with up-and-coming actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/paul-rudd data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Rudd" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul Rudd</a> while living in St. Louis. Rudd described Hamm as “one of those unfair guys who are good looking, really funny, and good at everything,” according to GQ magazine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1995, Hamm decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Packing up everything he owned, he drove to his aunt and uncle’s house in West Los Angeles. He stayed with them until he got his own apartment, which he shared with a series of roommates.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 title="Movies and TV Shows" data-anchor-id=movies-and-tv-shows class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Movies and TV Shows</h2><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Space Cowboys, Providence, and Kissing Jessica Stein</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For years, Hamm struggled to find work as an actor. He made his television and movie debuts in 2000, with bit parts in the comedy series The Hughleys and the adventure flick Space Cowboys. Landing a recurring role, Hamm appeared on the television drama Providence from 2000 to 2001.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also around this time, Hamm got a part on the Los Angeles stage in Lipschtick, written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen. It was turned into the 2001 independent film Kissing Jessica Stein, in which Hamm also appeared. Off-screen he developed a relationship with Westfeldt, and the two eventually moved in together.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The Division and The Unit</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2002, Hamm had a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it part in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/mel-gibson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mel Gibson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mel Gibson</a>’s military drama We Were Soldiers. He also began his two-year run on the police drama The Division, playing Inspector Nate Russo opposite Bonnie Bedelia and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/nancy-mckeon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nancy McKeon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nancy McKeon</a>. After its cancellation, Hamm made guest appearances on such shows as Charmed, CSI: Miami, and Numb3rs. He also landed recurring roles on the military drama The Unit and the dramatic comedy What About Brian.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Breakthrough Role as Don Draper on Mad Men</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2007, Hamm took on his most famous character to date, playing philandering ad executive Don Draper on AMC’s Mad Men, after auditioning seven times for the role. Set in the 1960s, Mad Men explored the lives of the employees of a top New York City ad agency. The cast also featured January Jones as his wife, Betty, and John Slattery as his boss Roger Sterling. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/elisabeth-moss data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elisabeth Moss" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elisabeth Moss</a> played Peggy, a secretary-turned-copywriter on the show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Don-Peggy relationship was challenging for Hamm, especially when he had to be hard on someone who “looks about 9 years old. It’s like kicking a puppy,” he told Daily Variety. But for Hamm, the character provided an opportunity to stretch as an actor. “Don, in a lot of ways, can be kind of mean, and that’s not my go-to thing... He’s kind of mean to a purpose, but it was a little tough,” he explained to the publication.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While promoting the show’s fifth season in 2012, Hamm got caught up in a media frenzy for his comments about reality TV stars in an interview. “Whether it’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/paris-hilton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paris Hilton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paris Hilton</a> or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/kim-kardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Kardashian" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kim Kardashian</a> or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated,” he told Elle UK. “Being... [an] idiot is a valuable commodity in this culture because you’re rewarded significantly.” Kardashian responded by calling Hamm “careless” for saying she was “stupid,” and the actor subsequently said he was surprised by the media attention over his remarks. He told The Hollywood Reporter that “we live in a world now where every word is micro-parsed and sometimes taken out of context, sometimes misunderstood.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over its run, Mad Men garnered stellar reviews and won several awards, including the 2011 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. Hamm personally won Golden Globes in 2008 and 2016, and received numerous Emmy Award nominations for his work as Don Draper, winning in 2015.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The Day the Earth Stood Still, Stolen, and Howl</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stepping away from the finely tailored vintage suits, Hamm appeared in the 2008 science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/keanu-reeves data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keanu Reeves" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Keanu Reeves</a>.
